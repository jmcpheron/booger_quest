# Understanding Node.js and npm

This is a demo project to help Jason understand how the heck this Node.js stuff works. 

I want to see a basic project and figure out my standard development enviorment. 

As a starting point, I can try making a web page/app that has some sort of interactive timer. Maybe with a game aspect, like can you tap the timer button several times consistantly.
